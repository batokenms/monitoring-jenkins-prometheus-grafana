# Verify Docker Binary Path:
Ensure the Docker binary is correctly mounted. 
Sometimes, the which docker command might not work correctly in all environments. Try specifying the full path directly if the dynamic path doesn't work.
If you are running Docker-in-Docker, ensure the container has the necessary privileges.

-v /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker

# Running Docker-in-Docker (DinD):

 If you are running Docker-in-Docker, ensure the container has the necessary privileges.

# Adjust Permissions on Docker Socket:
Sometimes, adjusting the permissions on the Docker socket can help. Be cautious with this approach, as it might expose your Docker daemon to security risks.

sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

# Review Docker Logs:
Check the logs of the Jenkins container for any specific error messages that might indicate what is going wrong.

docker logs jenkins
